Ah extension methods... where would we be without them? Writing slightly more code to perform common functions that's where! I am fairly sure everyone has their own set of string extensions so I though I'd share what I currently have then you guys can shoot it down and direct me to / yell at me something more useful. Everybody wins!

<div style="clear: both;">I am also experimenting with using Github's Gist for my code samples (with help from a handy <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/github-gist/">wordpress plugin</a>). The idea is this makes it easier for me to update and you to clone, steal, comment, share etc. Let me know if it works.</div>
