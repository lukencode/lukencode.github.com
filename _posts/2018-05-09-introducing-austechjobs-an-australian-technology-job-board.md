It has been a couple of years (kids will do that) in the wilderness but I am back working on my blog and on an exciting new project.

 **[Austechjobs](https://austechjobs.com.au)** is a job board focusing on technology jobs in Australia. This includes developers, designers, support, sys admin and management.

In my role as Development Manager at QIMR Berghofer I am often involved in recruiting developers for my team. I have always been disappointed with the recruiter spam and mountains of unqualified applications that posting to the big job sites brings. My hope is Austechjobs will be a place to find the best IT jobs at the best companies in Australia and in turn for employers to reach the best IT professionals in Australia.

Austechjobs will provide incentives for employers to list positions with enough detail for job seekers to see what they are in for. Initially at least this means positions recruitment agencies will not be accepted. Posting a job on the site is free during the launch but this will change as more jobs and functionality are available. If you have any questions or feedback contact me on [luke@austechjobs.com.au](mailto:luke@austechjobs.com.au) for more information visit  [austechjobs.com.au/about](https://austechjobs.com.au/about).

The site itself is a custom asp.net core application and since this is a technical blog I hope to post some snippets of code I have been working on soon.
