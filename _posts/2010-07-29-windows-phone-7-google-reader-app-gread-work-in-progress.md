<p>I’ve spent the last couple of days playing around with some Windows Phone 7 development. I decided to create a simple Google reader client as a practice app that later on down the track might at least be useful to me. Considering I have no background in Silverlight (mainly just web applications) I think I’ve managed to come quite a long way in a short amount of time. </p>  <div style="padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px auto; padding-left: 0px; width: 637px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; padding-top: 0px" id="scid:66721397-FF69-4ca6-AEC4-17E6B3208830:8f284cef-2448-4db0-8757-dcac1fb8328a" class="wlWriterEditableSmartContent"><a style="border:0px" href="http://cid-f01a240b2645ac50.skydrive.live.com/redir.aspx?page=browse&amp;resid=F01A240B2645AC50!106&amp;type=5"><img style="border:0px" alt="View GREAD" src="http://lukencode.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/InlineRepresentationd420332b7adc45dda78014e8c8d29201.jpg" /></a><div style="width:637px;text-align:right;" ><a href="http://cid-f01a240b2645ac50.skydrive.live.com/redir.aspx?page=browse&amp;resid=F01A240B2645AC50!106&amp;type=5">View Full Album</a></div></div>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>The app current pulls in the given users unread counts and labels on the home screen with the labels located a swoosh to the right. From there you can jump straight to view a story or drill down into one of your labels.</p>  <p>Before I go too much further I would like to try get some feedback/ideas on what people want from a Google reader client (if anything). </p>  <p>The design is obviously a little dodgy at the moment my main plan here is to try utilized the wp7 concept of horizontal space. I am waiting for the official panorama/pivot controls and will look to implement those. </p>  <p>Features wise at the moment all the client does is query the Google reader api for feeds an stories. I am going to implement the core reader functionality – read and unread, starring and notes as well as some type of social sharing.&#160; I’d like to know how important offline reading / caching is to people so I can decide how much effort I need to put into that side of the application.</p>  <p>If you have any ideas let me know in the comments or on twitter - <a href="http://twitter.com/lukencode" target="_blank">@lukencode</a>.</p>
