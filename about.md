My name is Luke Lowrey - by day I am a "full stack" professional web developer focusing on .NET technologies but come nightfall I become a "full-stack" web developer who likes building Windows Phone apps and contributing to cool open source projects.

I am currently working with some cool dudes at the [Queensland Institute of Medical Research](http://www.qimr.edu.au/) curing cancer and what not.

If you want to find out more about me (you are of course only human) you could:

 * Check out [my github stuff](http://github.com/lukencode)
